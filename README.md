# Engine Testing Book

With the growing number of new devs joining the chess programming community, I thought it would be nice to compile a resource that explains how to properly test your engine during development.

This repository uses [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/), and can be viewed locally by running:

```bash
mdbook serve --open
```

Alternatively, you can view the published book [here](https://dannyhammer.github.io/engine-testing-guide/).

## Feedback

I am very open to feedback. If you notice incorrect information within the guide or want to make other improvements, please make a PR!
