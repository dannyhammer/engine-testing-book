# Engine Testing Book

With the growing number of new devs joining the chess programming community, I thought it would be nice to compile a resource that explains how to properly test your engine during development.

This repository uses [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/), and can be viewed locally by running:

```bash
mdbook serve --open
```

I intend to publish this book to a static webpage (once I figure out how!).
