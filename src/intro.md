# Proper Engine Testing

How do you know that the changes you're making to your engine are beneficial to it's performance?
How can you be sure that you've actually _improved_ the strength of your engine?
The answer is by thoroughly testing your engine after _every_ change.

This guide aims to explain the process of testing during the development of your engine.
We will first look at _why_ testing is important.
Next, we'll focus on _what_ kind of tests we should be running and how to interpret the results.
After that, we'll see _how_ to run these tests, using a popular framework called [OpenBench](https://github.com/AndyGrant/OpenBench).

In the end, my hope is that you will not only have a better understanding of how and why to test your engine, but that you will also know how to set up and use OpenBench to serve as your primary testing framework.
